Project Structure

- bot.js (main file)
- config.json (config for client login)
- deploy-commands.js (script for deploying and updating commands)
- commands (directory for the commands)
- events (directory for the different events)
- utility (shared functions)
config.json

This json file, located in the root directory of the project, includes login info for the bot to run and update/deploy the slash commands. You won't be able to run the bot without this file. If the file does not exist, create the file with the following content:

{
	"token": "your-token-goes-here",
	"clientId": "your-application-id-goes-here",
	"guildId": "your-server-id-goes-here"
}

token: Your discord's bot token, created in the dev portal
clientId: Your application-ID that can be found on the dev portal
guildId: A server-ID the bot is on to deploy and update the commands.
bot.js (Main file)

The bot.js file is the main code for the bot. From here, the slash commands and events are registered. It registers all events from the /events directory and all shlash commands from the /commands directory.

At this point in time, this file creates the database tables. In the future, this will be migrated to /utility/dbHelper.js. New tables can be created like this:

db.run(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS guilds (
	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
	guildid TEXT NOT NULL
)`);

The tables will only be created if they don't exist. Meaning, if you change a table in the code, it won't update until that table is deleted. At the moment, you can only update the tables by deleting the database.

The Code also reads the content of the /events and /commands directories. For the events, it lets discord.js emit the events to the appropriate files. For the commands, it reads the "data" property and the "execute" function. To learn more, read the slash commands section

After logging in, The bot will fetch all announcements from the database and create reaction collectors. The logic for what happens with this data is in ./utility/jobpost-reaction
deploy-commands.js

This script deploys or updates commands. It automatically detects the commands in the /commands directory and reads the data property. To learn more about commands, read the Slash commands section.
Slash commands

All slash commands are stored in the /commands folder. When creating a command, create a file and insert the following content:

const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require('discord.js');

module.exports = {
	data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
		.setName('example')
		.setDescription('Example description')
	async execute(interaction) {
		await interaction.reply('Hello!');
	},
}

Every command needs at least the data property and execute function. These are automatically loaded by the main file into the bot when running it. When creating a new command or updating the options of a command run the deploy-commands.js file or run npm run deploy.

Generally, when creating commands, and you need functions that you will use in both the bot and the main file, create this functions in the /utility directory, to prevent circular imports.
Event handling

Similar to the slash commands, the events are also automatically loaded from the main file. To create a new Discord bot event handler, create a file in /events with the name of the event, and insert this code:

const { Events } = require('discord.js');

module.exports = {
	name: Events.ClientReady,
	once: true,
	execute(client) {
		console.log(`Ready! Logged in as ${client.user.tag}`);
	},
};

The name and execute are required. The once option is only for this example, because the ClientReady event is only executed once.
Utility Directory
The utility directory stores general functions that can be imported and used in commands, in the main file or some other place. Generally, it should not import anything from the main file or other files like the client or db property to prevent circular imports.
